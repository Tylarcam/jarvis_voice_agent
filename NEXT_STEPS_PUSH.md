# Next Steps: GitHub Push Point

## ‚úÖ Current State
- All core features are working:
  - Gemini LLM integration
  - Voice/text conversation
  - All tools (weather, web search, email, open directory, list files, OS info) are registered and functional
- Codebase is clean and organized
- `.gitignore` is set up to exclude venv, __pycache__, archive, and other non-source files
- Documentation files (`WORKING_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md`, `STRUCTURE_AND_TECH.md`) are up to date

## üö© Where We Left Off
- This is the recommended point to push the codebase to GitHub
- Only this codebase should be pushed (no extra files, no legacy or stub directories)
- All sensitive information (API keys, secrets) should remain in `.env` (which is gitignored)

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps
1. **Commit all changes:**
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Stable: Gemini agent, tools, docs, and .gitignore ready for GitHub"
   ```
2. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```sh
   git push origin main
   ```
3. **Verify on GitHub:**
   - Check that only the intended files are present
   - Ensure `.env` and other ignored files are not pushed

**You are now ready to share or collaborate on this codebase with confidence!**
