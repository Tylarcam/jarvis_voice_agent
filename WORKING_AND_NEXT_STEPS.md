# Friday Jarvis Voice Agent: Working Features & Next Steps

## ‚úÖ What Works
- **Gemini LLM Integration:** The agent boots up with Google Gemini as the backend.
- **Conversational Agent:** You can have a conversation with the agent using LiveKit's real-time voice/text interface.
- **Tool Registration:** The following tools are available and can be called by the agent:
  - Weather lookup
  - Web search (DuckDuckGo)
  - Send email (Gmail SMTP)
  - Open directory (fuzzy search + Cursor integration)
  - List files in a directory
  - Get OS info

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview
- **agent.py:** Defines the Assistant class, registers all tools, and injects the LLM backend.
- **main.py:** Entrypoint for launching the agent with Gemini (or other LLMs if extended).
- **tools.py:** Houses all decorated function tools for the agent to use.
- **LiveKit:** Handles real-time communication and session management.
- **prompts.py:** Defines the agent's persona and session instructions.
- **requirements.txt:** Lists all dependencies.
- **.env:** Stores API keys and secrets.

## üìö Tutorial Insights
- The agent is designed to be extensible: "...you can actually create any tool that you want, as long as you can express that as a Python function." ([Transcript Reference](#))
- Tools are registered as decorated async functions and passed to the Assistant class.
- The agent can be deployed in multiple environments (local, cloud, mobile, web).

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps: Add MCP Tools
- **Integrate MCP (Multi-Chain Protocol) tools** for advanced agent capabilities.
- Design tools as async Python functions, decorate, and register in `agent.py`.
- Update prompts and documentation to reflect new capabilities.
- Test tool invocation with Gemini and other LLMs.

This architecture is modular and extensible. You can add new tools, swap LLMs, or deploy in new environments with minimal changes.
